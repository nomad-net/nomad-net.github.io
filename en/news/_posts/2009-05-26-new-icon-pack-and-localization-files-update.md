title: New icon pack and localization files update
---
Just uploaded new icon pack (Gnome) in the [appropriate](/en/iconpack) section. Also I have updated [files for Nomad localization](/en/downloads) (Removed unnecessary string that can lead to crush in the current Nomad version and some missing values added to English localization).

*Notes to translators*: Due to bug in the program, current Nomad version is sensitive to .lng file validity. So, while this bug is not fixed, translate substitutions with care. And, of course, if you find any problems, feel free to mail me.
