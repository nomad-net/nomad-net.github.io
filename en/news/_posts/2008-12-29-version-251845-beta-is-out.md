title: Version 2.5.1.845 beta is out
---
After long period and bunch of internal builds, new version is finally out. There is enormous number of new features, improvements and bugfixes. One of the main highlights of this version is greatly improved archives support framework. Now you can create new archives, update existed and delete files from archives (both 7z formats and wcx-packer plug-ins supported). There so many improvement so I don't see necessity to list them all there, it is better to [download new version](/en/downloads) and see by yourself. For full changes log you can go [there](/history.txt).
