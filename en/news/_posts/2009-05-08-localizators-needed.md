title: Localizators Needed
---
If you like **Nomad.NET** and do not like interface in English (or simple prefer interface in your language), you can help me, and create localization for your language. With features added in the latest beta you can create simple text file localization and test it in action. I have prepared and uploaded [instructions](/en/downloads/nomad-localization.zip) how to create you own localization, you can find it in [downloads](/en/downloads/) section. I have also added all localizations created by me into this archive, so you can use them as basis for your localization (for example, you can take english localization file and translate it line by line).

Nomad is freeware, so I cannot give you working key or something like that in exchange, but I can (and I will) include your name into thanks section and into nomad itself.

*Note*: If you native English speaker, or if you have strong English skills, you can also help me by reviewing English localization (my English is not perfect, and I think that my localization contains mistakes).
