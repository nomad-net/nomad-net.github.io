title: Version 2.6.8.1115 beta is out
---
New release now stable enough for beta. This release mostly contains usability improvements and user requests implementation (check the [changelog](/history.txt), because there is a lot of them). Most important are ability to hide files and folders, improvements in folder customization, setup and upgrade wizard on start, and some others.

This version was posted only in groups right now (you can download it [here](http://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net/browse_thread/thread/135d0f4fb75cd02a)), because new upgrade wizard need some testing. I hope in a week post this version everywhere.
