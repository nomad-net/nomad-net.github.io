title: Version 2.2.5.605 beta is out
---
This version intended to be simple bug fix release. But with time several important new features was added too. Starting from this version code optimization was began, so this version take less time to start, work faster and consume less memory than previous ones. Many, many bugs was fixed too, this release is quite stable, so I recommend upgrade to this version. As always you can take new version from [downloads](/en/downloads) page.  
*Note*: You must setup application from the beginning, because all settings, except bookmarks was not copied from previous version.
