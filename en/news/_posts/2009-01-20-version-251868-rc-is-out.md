title: Version 2.5.1.868 RC is out
---
This release does not contain any new functionality, instead it contains only bug fixes. Because all known bugs was fixed I have changed version status from beta to release candidate. And almost forget, this version also includes some new menu icons and completely new fancy about dialog logo. Take it in the [downloads](/en/downloads) section as usual.

P.S. I also want to release stable final version as fast as possible, so from this version forward I have two development branches (alpha and release). So, in the nearest future you can expect new alpha with lot new functionality (tabs, for example) in [groups](https://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net).
