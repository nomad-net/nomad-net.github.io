title: Happy new 2010 year
---
This year was been very productive for Nomad, many features were implemented, more to come, and even more planned. I have a grandiose plans to make #1 orthodox file manager in the world, and I hope that coming year will be much more productive and interesting. So many wishes for all current (and future) users of **Nomad.NET**, and you can expect a holiday gift in the first week of new year (hint: new version) :)
