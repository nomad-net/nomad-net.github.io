title: Version 3.0.0.2135 alpha is out

It is here at last! Long awaited version 3.0.x!

You can download it [here](/en/downloads). Changes are countless and you can find short description of most (but not all) new features [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nomad-net/8lzFUR6G4zY/KIX_SKwxEokJ), later I will update history.txt with detailed description of what's new in this version.

Also this is alpha, very stable but still alpha, so importing settings from previous version is disabled. Binaries optimization is also disabled by default (however you can compile it if you wish). Full debug information is enabled in this build, so this can slowdown application a bit, especially in comparison with current stable version. However there is a lot of speed optimizations done in this release, so I think , so I think it should faster actually.
