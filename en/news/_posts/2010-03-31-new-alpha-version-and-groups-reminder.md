title: New alpha version and groups reminder
---
This week one of **Nomad.NET** users noted me, that new version is out, but he does not see and mention about it in News or anywhere on this site. This post is a reminder about [**Nomad.NET** group](https://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net), where you can find various discussions about nomad features, post bug reports or download latest alpha versions. In general you can consider this groups as official **Nomad.NET** forums.

Also do not forget about "Check for Updates" command in help menu. Using this command you can always check for new version right from nomad.

And last but not least, last stable version is 2.6.8.x, but latest available version (in groups) is 2.8.5.x. This version is alpha, but it contains enormous number of new features, bug fixes, etc. So if you want to check or test it, welcome:  
[Version 2.8.0.1410](https://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net/browse_thread/thread/28c1165a1cde1e4d)  
[Version 2.8.5.1523](https://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net/browse_thread/thread/9f2d5a932dd91f57)
