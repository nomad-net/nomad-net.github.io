title: Version 3.2.0.2850 rc is out
---
Last step before long awaited final version. Contains updated localizations (many thanks to [translators](/en/about)), various small improvements and bugfixes of course. As usual detailed history can be found [here](/history.txt), and latest version you can grab [here](/en/downloads).

Also with this release I've updated [theme.xsd](/theme.xsd) file, you can use this scheme for creating your own Nomad themes.

P.S. Translators wanted! If you want translate Nomad to your language, or to language that you know well - you are welcome. I promise all help you need from my side (and cookies!) while you creating your perfect localization. Localization instructions (with all localizations available at the moment), you can find in [downloads](/en/downloads).
