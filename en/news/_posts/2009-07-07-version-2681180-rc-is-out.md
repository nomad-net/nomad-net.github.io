title: Version 2.6.8.1180 RC is out
---
Long awaited RC is out. All changes for 2.6.8 branch is frozen, so this release contains only bug-fixes. Almost all bugs reported from the previous version was fixed. As usually you can grab the program on [downloads](/en/downloads) page.

*Note*: I mentioned reported errors with sense. If I do not know about existence of particular error, I cannot fix it! All messages like: "Your program is buggy, please fix it before I can start using it", will be ignored. Please, be specific, if you encounter a bug, and when it is not hard to you, send me a mail with description (provide as much details as you can). Believe me this will be good for us all :)
