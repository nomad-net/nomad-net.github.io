title: New localization - Italian
---
Italian localization just arrived on site. Many thanks to **Claudio Vicari** for made this localization available. This localization intended to use with latest stable version (2.8.7.1740). If you want to use it, simply download it [here](/en/downloads) and extract archive content to Nomad root folder.

Localization instructions and all available text localization files updated to the actual state, so if you wish to localize Nomad into your language you should download and use updated *nomad-localization.zip* file. Do not forget to read readme.txt first, because it contains some useful localization tips.
