title: New localization - French
---
New first class localization arrived, this time for French language. Many thanks goes to **Guy Pouliot** for his superb work. This localization intended to use with latest stable version (2.8.7.1740), so if you wish to use it, download it [here](/en/downloads) and simply extract archive content to Nomad root folder.

Localization files for other languages also updated a bit. These files still apply for stable version only, but update is coming (both for localization files and Nomad itself).
