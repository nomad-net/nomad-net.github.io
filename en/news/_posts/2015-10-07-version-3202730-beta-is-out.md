title: Version 3.2.0.2730 beta is out
---
After very long break I can finally present the very new Nomad version which is available for download. Despite for a long period of silence Nomad development wasn't stopped all this years, it was not very active however. Latest release contains a lot of new features and fixes many bugs. Some new bugs will be introduced too.

Especially I would like to note updated and extended plugin framework. Documentation for the API is still not ready (I will create it only by demand), so if you have desire to improve Nomad in any way, feel free to contact me directly. In this new version, you'll also find a new plugin - VirusTotalPlugin which, as you can see from its name, allows you to check any suspicious file with the appropriate service. More detailed changes history can be found [here](/history.txt) and new version is available for download [here](/en/downloads).

Starting from this version only Windows XP and later OSes will be supported. This doesn't means that the program will stop working under older Windows versions, most likely it will work as intended, but no tests will be performed under outdated OSes and errors will be fixed only in exceptional cases.
