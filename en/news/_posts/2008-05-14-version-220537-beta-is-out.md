title: Version 2.2.0.537 beta is out
---
New **Nomad.NET** version is out at last. In this version I have changed program versioning, now first number means great changes in program, second means that important feature has been added (Major version), third means that minor feature has been added (Minor version), and last number is number of commits into the repositary (Revision number). When major version number changed, minor version number is cleared, revision number is persistent. With this release I have also publish this site on the web. You can download new version here, version history can be found [here](/history.txt).
