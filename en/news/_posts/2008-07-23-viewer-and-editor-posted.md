Due to some requests. [Editor](/en/old-editor) and [Viewer](/en/old-viewer) is extracted from old nomad installation and placed on [downloads](/en/downloads) page in separate packages. You can use these programs with **Nomad.NET**, just download files, extract them into nomad folder and setup editor and viewer path in options.
