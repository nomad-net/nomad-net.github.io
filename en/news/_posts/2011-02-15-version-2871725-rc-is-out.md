title: Version 2.8.7.1725 RC is out
---
As you can expect from number this version is service release and contains bugfixes only (including annoying rename bug). No critical error found during past months, so I can say that it is almost-almost final. This release is also including both 32 and 64 bit 7z.dll versions.
