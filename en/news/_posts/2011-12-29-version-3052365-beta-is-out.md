title: Version 3.0.5.2365 beta is out
---
Happy new year to everybody! As promised I release new version in the year 2011, consider it as my small gift to all you, my fellow users :)
This version contains several improvements, most important is support for custom plug-ins, but there is also improvements in ftp and shell file systems, new and updated featured, and of course, bunch of bug fixes. Also in this release you will find two demo plug-ins written by me, source code for these plug-ins will be published a bit later (first week of January).

Almost all errors reported by you were fixed, so if you are using version 3 you should upgrade. However if you using stable version now, consider upgrade too. New version offer much-much more that latest stable release and it should stable enough.

As usual release history is [here](/history.txt), and download new version from [here](/en/downloads).
