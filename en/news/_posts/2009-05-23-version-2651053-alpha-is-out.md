title: Version 2.6.5.1053 alpha is out
---
New alpha release. This release mostly contains usability improvements and user requests implementation (check the [changelog](/history.txt), because there is a lot of them). But there is more, nomad receives major volume framework update, as well as, experimental support for different ftp encodings.

Also with this release **Nomad.NET** achieves two important milestones: firstly, number of repositary commits grows above 1000 mark, and the second, it is about one year passed after first public release (2.0.0), so you can see major improvements in all areas last year, and feel speed of nomad development :)

This release is important for me, and I hope, for all of you. So I decided to post this message not only in [groups area](https://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net) but also here. You can download this alpha in [groups](https://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net/browse_thread/thread/3ec1867ecbb9a3dc).
