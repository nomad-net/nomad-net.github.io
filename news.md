## Ukrainian localization added / <time datetime="2010-03-23">Mar 23, 2010</time>

Now you can download Ukrainian **Nomad.NET** localization. I've been very busy with new Nomad version, so right now this localization available as separate download only. Many thanks for **Igor Kovalenko** for its work!

To install localization simple extract downloaded archive into Nomad folder and select new language in options.

## Happy new 2010 year / <time datetime="2009-12-31">Dec 31, 2009</time>

This year was been very productive for Nomad, many features were implemented, more to come, and even more planned. I have a grandiose plans to make #1 orthodox file manager in the world, and I hope that coming year will be much more productive and interesting. So many wishes for all current (and future) users of **Nomad.NET**, and you can expect a holiday gift in the first week of new year (hint: new version) :)

## Version 2.6.8.1195 RC is out / <time datetime="2009-09-01">Sep 1, 2009</time>

Yet another milestone passed on the road to stable release. This time, in addition to bugfixes, this release implements several user requests. Also there is new Nomad localization - Dutch, many thanks to Martijn Weisbeek. New version, as well as updated nomad-localizaion.zip can be found on the [downloads][2] page.

## Version 2.6.8.1180 RC is out / <time datetime="2009-07-07">Jul 7, 2009</time>

Long awaited RC is out. All changes for 2.6.8 branch is frozen, so this release contains only bug-fixes. Almost all bugs reported from the previous version was fixed. As usually you can grab the program on [downloads][2] page.

*Note*: I mentioned reported errors with sense. If I do not know about existence of particular error, I cannot fix it! All messages like: "Your program is buggy, please fix it before I can start using it", will be ignored. Please, be specific, if you encounter a bug, and when it is not hard to you, send me a mail with description (provide as much details as you can). Believe me this will be good for us all :)

## Version 2.6.8.1166 beta is out / <time datetime="2009-06-08">Jun 8, 2009</time>

This is maintenance release, it contains bugfixes, various localization typos fixes and changes in dialogs layout for better and easier localization, so this version is better suitable for translate. Also this version introduces full German localization (thanks  to Sven Knurr). Files for Nomad localization updated as well. Grab them in the [downloads][2] section.

## New icon pack and localization files update / <time datetime="2009-05-26">May 26, 2009</time>

Just uploaded new icon pack (Gnome) in the [appropriate](iconpack) section. Also I have updated [files for Nomad localization][2] (Removed unnecessary string that can lead to crush in the current Nomad version and some missing values added to English localization).

*Notes to translators*: Due to bug in the program, current Nomad version is sensitive to .lng file validity. So, while this bug is not fixed, translate substitutions with care. And, of course, if you find any problems, feel free to mail me.

## Version 2.6.8.1140 beta is out / <time datetime="2009-05-13">May 13, 2009</time>

New beta release. This time it contains only bugfixes found in the previous version. Also this is public release, so it will be uploaded to various soft-catalogs. As usual you can grab it in [appropriate][2] section.

## Localizators Needed / <time datetime="2009-05-08">May 8, 2009</time>

If you like **Nomad.NET** and do not like interface in English (or simple prefer interface in your language), you can help me, and create localization for your language. With features added in the latest beta you can create simple text file localization and test it in action. I have prepared and uploaded [instructions](downloads/nomad-localization.zip) how to create you own localization, you can find it in [downloads][2] section. I have also added all localizations created by me into this archive, so you can use them as basis for your localization (for example, you can take english localization file and translate it line by line).

Nomad is freeware, so I cannot give you working key or something like that in exchange, but I can (and I will) include your name into thanks section and into nomad itself.

*Note*: If you native English speaker, or if you have strong English skills, you can also help me by reviewing English localization (my English is not perfect, and I think that my localization contains mistakes).

## Version 2.6.8.1115 beta is out / <time datetime="2009-04-24">Apr 24, 2009</time>

New release now stable enough for beta. This release mostly contains usability improvements and user requests implementation (check the [changelog][1], because there is a lot of them). Most important are ability to hide files and folders, improvements in folder customization, setup and upgrade wizard on start, and some others.

This version was posted only in groups right now (you can download it [here](http://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net/browse_thread/thread/135d0f4fb75cd02a)), because new upgrade wizard need some testing. I hope in a week post this version everywhere.

## New Icon Pack / <time datetime="2009-04-19">Apr 19, 2009</time>

[Icon packs](iconpack) page was updated:
- First, I have created and uploaded icon pack based on [VisualPharm](http://visualpharm.com/hadware_icon_set/) free icons. It is relatively small and consist from only 13 icons, but these icons are very professional and good-looking.
- Second, Tango icon pack was updated to 0.8.90 version (some new icons, some new extensions).
- And at last, third, all other icon packs received small updates as well.

## Version 2.6.5.1053 alpha is out / <time datetime="2009-05-23">Mar 23, 2009</time>

New alpha release. This release mostly contains usability improvements and user requests implementation (check the [changelog][1], because there is a lot of them). But there is more, nomad receives major volume framework update, as well as, experimental support for different ftp encodings.

Also with this release **Nomad.NET** achieves two important milestones: firstly, number of repositary commits grows above 1000 mark, and the second, it is about one year passed after first public release (2.0.0), so you can see major improvements in all areas last year, and feel speed of nomad development :)

This release is important for me, and I hope, for all of you. So I decided to post this message not only in [groups area][3] but also here. You can download this alpha in [groups](https://groups.google.com/group/nomad-net/browse_thread/thread/3ec1867ecbb9a3dc).

Bugfixing only release. In this version several crushes was fixed (related to reparse and mount points), some smaller fixes applied too. I hope that this version does not contains critical bugs, so it can be last release candidate.

## My birthday and new alpha / <time datetime="2009-01-28">Jan 28, 2009</time>

## Version 2.5.1.868 RC is out / <time datetime="2009-01-20">Jan 20, 2009</time>

This release does not contain any new functionality, instead it contains only bug fixes. Because all known bugs was fixed I have changed version status from beta to release candidate. And almost forget, this version also includes some new menu icons and completely new fancy about dialog logo. Take it in the [downloads][2] section as usual.

P.S. I also want to release stable final version as fast as possible, so from this version forward I have two development branches (alpha and release). So, in the nearest future you can expect new alpha with lot new functionality (tabs, for example) in [groups][3].

## Version 2.5.1.845 beta is out / <time datetime="2008-12-29">Dec 29, 2008</time>

After long period and bunch of internal builds, new version is finally out. There is enormous number of new features, improvements and bugfixes. One of the main highlights of this version is greatly improved archives support framework. Now you can create new archives, update existed and delete files from archives (both 7z formats and wcx-packer plug-ins supported). There so many improvement so I don't see necessity to list them all there, it is better to [download new version][2] and see by yourself. For full changes log you can go [there][1].

## Hosting changed / <time datetime="2008-10-27">Oct 27, 2008</time>

Also entire site is now available under nomad-net.info domain, and now you don't need to remember long version of site address (this address is still available, and will be available in future: <https://sites.google.com/a/nomad-net.info/en/>).

## Version 2.3.0.685 RC is out / <time datetime="2008-08-14">Aug 14, 2008</time>

After almost two months waiting new release is out. As you see, this release is marked as release candidate, not beta, this means that program is stable enough to leave beta stage. This release, as always, intended to be bug-fix only release (previous version introduces two critical errors), but with time it grows into something big. So the highlights of this release is improved look: themes, icon packs, various layout changes, advanced tooltips, etc. List of other improvements and bug fixes you can find in changes history. Grab new version on [downloads][2] page.

This version intended to be simple bug fix release. But with time several important new features was added too. Starting from this version code optimization was began, so this version take less time to start, work faster and consume less memory than previous ones. Many, many bugs was fixed too, this release is quite stable, so I recommend upgrade to this version. As always you can take new version from [downloads][2] page.  
*Note*: You must setup application from the beginning, because all settings, except bookmarks was not copied from previous version.
